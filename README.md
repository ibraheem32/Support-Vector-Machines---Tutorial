# SVM Kernel Trick Tutorial

This repository contains the code and tutorial for implementing Support Vector Machines (SVM) with a focus on the Kernel Trick. The tutorial is designed for learners with basic machine learning knowledge and provides both theoretical explanations and a practical Python implementation using scikit-learn on a real-world dataset.

## Contents

- **Tutorial as pdf**: A detailed tutorial on SVM and the Kernel Trick.
- **main.ipynb**: A Jupyter Notebook containing the complete code with explanations and visualizations.

## Overview

This tutorial covers:
- **Introduction to SVM:** Overview of support vector machines and their role in classification.
- **Mathematical Intuition:** Explanation of support vectors, margin maximization, and the dual formulation using Lagrange multipliers.
- **Kernel Trick:** How kernel functions (linear, polynomial, and RBF) map data into higher-dimensional spaces to handle non-linear separability.
- **Python Implementation:** Step-by-step code for data loading, training SVM models with different kernels, and visualizing decision boundaries using accessible, color-blind friendly visualizations.
- **Evaluation & Comparison:** Model performance evaluation using accuracy scores and a classification report.
